                1. Dynamic Nested Dictionary Handling
                Given a dynamically nested dictionary, write a Python function that can retrieve any value from the dictionary using a string-based path.
                
                Example input:
                
                python
                Copy code
                nested_dict = {
                    "level1": {
                        "level2": {
                            "level3": {
                                "value": 42
                            }
                        }
                    }
                }
                
                path = "level1.level2.level3.value"
                Expected output: 42
                
                Requirements:
                
                Handle paths of arbitrary length.
                Raise an error if the path is invalid.
                Optimize for performance if the dictionary is very large.''',
        2: '''2. Frequency Counting Using Dictionaries
                Given a large text file, write a function that uses dictionaries to count the frequency of each word. Additionally, the function should:
                
                Ignore case and punctuation.
                Return the word with the highest frequency and its count.
                Optimize for performance with multi-threading or multi-processing if the file is very large.
                Example input:
                
                python
                Copy code
                text = "This is a test. This test is only a test."
                Expected output:
                
                python
                Copy code
                {'this': 3, 'is': 2, 'a': 2, 'test': 3}
                Most frequent word: 'this', Frequency: 3'''
